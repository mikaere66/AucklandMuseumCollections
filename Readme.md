# Auckland Museum Collections

The Auckland Museum Collections app is intended to provide simple and
straightforward access to the Auckland Museum online collections API.

All data is sourced in real-time using the .json format, and processed
within the app using Kotlin Serialization. Search history, Favourites,
and Settings are stored locally in a Room database using official APIs.

For this app to function **fully**, you will need to provide *your own* API key
from [Auckland Museum](https://github.com/AucklandMuseum/AucklandMuseum_API/wiki/(1)-API-Basics#getting-started)
